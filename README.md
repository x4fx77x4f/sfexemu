# SFExEmu

A crude reimplementation of StarfallEx in the browser. Only 2D stuff will ever be supported. I'd like to make a remake with support for 3D, but that would be quite the undertaking (and it will be in a different repo if I ever do).

## Usage

Put the folder somewhere on your webserver. It doesn't matter where. Serverside scripting is not required. If you want a quick and easy static webserver, I'd recommend [static-server](https://github.com/nbluis/static-server#readme).
